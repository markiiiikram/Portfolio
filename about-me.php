                      Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Former teacher turned enthusiastic coder,
                      currently refining my craft as a Fullstack Developer at
                      Netmatters. Armed with a versatile toolkit encompassing
                      PHP, SQL, JavaScript, SASS, and HTML5, I'm crafting
                      digital solutions that captivate and inspire.
                      <br /><br />
                      Transitioning from the classroom to the codebase, I'm
                      fueled by a passion for exploration and a hunger for
                      knowledge. Join me as we embark on a journey of discovery,
                      navigating through the ever-evolving landscape of
                      technology and pushing boundaries along the way!
                      <br /><br />
                      Outside of coding, I love diving into new subjects, gaming, and experimenting with projects.
                      Whether it's learning a new language, mastering the latest game, or starting a new project,
                      I'm always eager for new challenges. Let's chat about our latest discoveries and gaming triumphs!
